Through this workshop, I learned how to use the namespace correctly. 
Although it was initially confusing to set up a namespace for a header file and its corresponding modules, it became familiar through workshops. 
Part 2 allowed me to revisit the concepts of arrays and pointers.
Also, I was also able to learn how to make standard input and output on C++.
I have only taken two classes yet, but I am very satisfied with this class. 
The professor clearly informs the concept and manages the class dynamically through the active participation of students.
I'd like to make a suggestion for this class. 
In addition to the essential tasks that all students have to do, it would be good to give us optional advanced tasks that are difficult. 
Because there are many students who are very passionate in our class. Successfully performing a difficult programming task would be a very satisfying process.
