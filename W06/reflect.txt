During this workshop, I felt that it was difficult to meet the exact empty line.
This is a problem caused by the insertion of \n at the end of the file using saveAs function. So I tried to solve this problem by not putting \n at the end, but in the test program, I had to leave it and solve it in a different way to pass the test.
Therefore, by changing the condition of the loop, the number of loops in the loadText function is reduced by one and the problem is solved.
And through this workshop, I learned how to use string class well. And I was able to study the file input and output of c++ in detail.
