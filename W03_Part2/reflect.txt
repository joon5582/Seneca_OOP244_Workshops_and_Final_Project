During this workshop, I discovered that there was a problem with the strnCpy function in my cstring module. 
Under certain conditions I missed inserting a null character at the end of the string. This was an error that could not be filtered from the test set in Workshop 1. I realized that the test set had to be made with many cases in mind.
In this workshop, I learned how to declare and use member variables and member functions of a class using encapsulation.
And I learned a lot by using formatting through cout class. It was a different concept from the existing C language printf, so I had a lot of difficulties at first, but I was able to use it comfortably after I got used to it.
