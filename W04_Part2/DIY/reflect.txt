Through this workshop, I learned how to use constructors and destructors.
I also realized that it is important to always call a function that defines the default safe state within the constructor, especially when the class has dynamic memory.
By returning the ostream reference, I learned that the object can be called comprehensively with other elements within cout.
I learned how to get a string input from a user through the get function.
