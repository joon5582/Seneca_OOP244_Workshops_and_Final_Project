I learned how to overload operators in the class in this workshop.
In particular, casting overloading can cause ambiguity, so I realized that it is important to represent the code clearly.
And I learned the importance of a safe default state. And also learned how to use the Helper functions. 
In particular, the difficult part was whether to return the reference or value, and because each situation had the right answer, I always had to make the program thinking about it.
I wanted to learn until the end of this semester with Fardad, so I'm sorry I couldn't. But I will definitely attend crash class.
Thank you Fardad!
